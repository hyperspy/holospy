Welcome to HoloSpy's documentation!
***********************************

**HoloSpy** is a Python package extending the functionality for 
multi-dimensional data analysis provided by the `HyperSpy 
<https://hyperspy.org/>`_ library. It is aimed at helping with the analysis of 
(off-axis) electron holography data. Originally developed as part of `HyperSpy 
<https://hyperspy.org/>`_, these and other domain specific features have been 
split out into dedicated packages with the :external+hyperspy:ref:`HyperSpy 2.0 
release <changes_2.0>`.

Check out the :ref:`installation` section for further information, including
how to start using this project.

.. note::

   This is an open-source community project: everyone is welcome to contribute.
   Please read our (see :ref:`contributing_label`) guidelines and get started!
